      <div class="text">
        <p>I'm a full-stack web developer and recent graduate of General Assembly's <a href="https://generalassemb.ly/education/web-development-immersive/washington-dc" target="_blank">Web Development Immersive</a> bootcamp, a twelve-week program that emphasizes object oriented programming, MVC framework, data modeling, test-driven development, and agile workflow.</p>
        <p>I decided to become a web developer because I love the balance that it strikes between logic and creativity and I love being able to create, solve problems, and learn new things every single day.</p>
        <p>I particularly enjoy working on the front-end as it gives me the opportunity to express my creativity. I am currently looking for a junior front-end or full-stack job opportunity in Portland, Oregon or San Francisco, California.</p>
        <p>Prior to taking the plunge into web development, I earned a B.A. in economics and worked in communications for an environmental nonprofit for three years.</p>

        <h2>Triply</h2>
        <p>Triply, a travel recommendation app, is the first full-stack web application that I built from scratch. I did all of the front-end and back-end work on this application. The app is built in Ruby on Rails and utilizes Bootstrap and Sass on the front end. It features a hand rolled user authentication system that allows users to create, read, update, and delete travel recommendations.<p>

        <h2>JoyRiide</h2>
        <p>JoyRiide is a business conceived during <a href="https://startupweekend.org/" target="_blank">Startup Weekend DC</a>. Over the course of the weekend, I worked collaboratively with business, finance, and research professionals on a business plan as well as financial projections. As the sole developer on the team, I also independently created a front-end website to communicate the business concept using HTML, CSS, Sass, Bootstrap, and JavaScript.<p>

        <p>MeetMe is the result of a collaborative project conducted by myself along with two other developers and two User Experience (UX) designers. The purpose of the project was to learn UX design principals while creating an app prototype. My teammates and I conducted user research, held a design studio, wireframed, mapped user flow, prototyped, and conducted user testing.</p>
