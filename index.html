    <h2><a name="about">About Me</a></h2>
      <p>Hello, I'm Leigh - a full-stack web developer and recent graduate of General Assembly's <a href="https://generalassemb.ly/education/web-development-immersive/washington-dc">Web Development Immersive</a> bootcamp, a twelve-week program that emphasizes object oriented programming, MVC framework, data modeling, test-driven development, and agile workflow. I decided to become a web developer because I love the balance that it strikes between logic and creativity and I love being able to create, solve problems, and learn new things every single day. Prior to taking the plunge into web development, I studied economics undergrad and worked in communications for an environmental nonprofit for three years.</p>

      <h3>Triply</h3>
      <p>Triply is a social networking site for travelers powered by Ruby on Rails. Users can log in and add travel recommendations to their favorite cities. I am still working adding functionality to the site - eventually users will be able to connect with one another so that they can share travel advice within their trusted network of friends and family.<p>
