  <div class="about-contact">
    <h1><a name="about">Hi, I'm Leigh.</a></h1>
      <p>I'm a full-stack web developer and recent graduate of General Assembly's <a href="https://generalassemb.ly/education/web-development-immersive/washington-dc">Web Development Immersive</a> bootcamp, a twelve-week program that emphasizes object oriented programming, MVC framework, data modeling, test-driven development, and agile workflow.</p>
      <p>I decided to become a web developer because I love the balance that it strikes between logic and creativity and I love being able to create, solve problems, and learn new things every single day. Prior to taking the plunge into web development, I studied economics undergrad and worked in communications for an environmental nonprofit for three years.</p>
